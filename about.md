My name is David Illes and I'm a software engineer, an occasional data scientist, and an MSc student on the Open University's MSc in Computing (Information Security and Forensics) program. This blog is intended to augment my efforts of transitioning into the cyber domain and will mostly contain my notes/writeups on retired machines and challenges from [HackTheBox.eu](https://www.hackthebox.eu/)
